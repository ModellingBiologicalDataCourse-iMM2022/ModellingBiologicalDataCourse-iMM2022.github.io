## To-do list for participants

We want to make sure that we can use all of the time available during the summer school for learning - and not for solving technical problems! This is why it is really important that you make sure that all the necessary software has been installed on your computer BEFORE the summer school starts. You should not leave this to the last minute so that there is time to solve any installation issues. If you have any problems or questions, don't hesitate to send a message to the course WhatsApp group!

We also ask you to carefully read the journal club paper (Pai et al. 2017) before the summer school starts. On Thursday, you will get to delve deeper into the modelling aspects of the paper - first with your team-mates and then with Chris Burge himself. But you will not have time to work through the entire paper from scratch so it is important you prepare beforehand.

Note that you will need to bring a laptop computer (with the necessary software installed) to all sessions.

<b>TO DO:</b>

1) Install <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">RStudio Desktop</a>.<br>
2) Install the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/psichomics.html">psichomics R package</a>.<br>
3) Read <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32537">this paper</a> for the journal club.<br>

## COVID-19 and visa requirements

We emphasize that it is your responsability to make sure that you fulfill all visa or COVID-19 related requirements for entering Portugal. If you need an invitation letter, please let us know ASAP. COVID-19 related requirements may change rapidly. You can find the most recent information on <a href="https://www.visitportugal.com/en/content/covid-19-measures-implemented-portugal">this page</a>.

<div id='id-venue'/>

## Venue

The summer school will take place in the self-study hall (*sala de autoaprendizagem*) of the ground floor of the Egas Moniz building, which houses the Institute of Molecular Medicine. For those staying at the hotel, a volunteer will come to meet you in the lobby at 9am on the first day of the summer school to make sure you make it to the right place at the right time. The hotel is located walking distance (25-30 minutes) from the iMM, although you also have the option of taking the metro (yellow line from Campo Pequeno to Cidade Universitária) or an Uber (very cheap in Lisbon!).

<div id='id-accommodation'/>

## Accommodation

You will be housed at the <a href="https://www.hotel3keuropa.pt/">Hotel 3K Europa</a>. To get there from the airport, you're probably best off either getting the metro or an Uber. A regular taxi will cost an arm and a leg and is thus not recommended. If you decide to get the metro, you need to first take the red line from the airport to Saldanha, and then the yellow line from Saldanha to Campo Pequeno. From the Campo Pequeno metro station, it is a 5-minute walk to the hotel.<br>
